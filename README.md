# Diabetes Case Study
Machine Learning model helps to gain an understanding of how to optimize a number of models using grid searching.


In this case study, we looked at predicting diabetes for 768 patients. There was a reasonable amount of class imbalance with just under 35% of patients having diabetes. There were no missing data, and initial looks at the data showed it would be difficult to separate patients with diabetes from those that did not have diabetes.

Three advanced modeling techniques were used to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. The most successful of these techniques proved to be an AdaBoost Classification technique, which had the following metrics:

 - Accuracy score for adaboost : 0.7792207792207793

 - Precision score adaboost : 0.7560975609756098

 - Recall score adaboost : 0.5636363636363636

 - F1 score adaboost : 0.6458333333333333
